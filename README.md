# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced program equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate foundation in philosophy, condensed into approximately 1–2 years at 20 hours per week. 

It assumes a commitment to rigorous reading, critical analysis, and written reflection to build analytical skills, ethical reasoning, and philosophical argumentation.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## Organization

The structure is divided into phases: 

- **Introduction** (fundamentals and orientation, ~3–4 months)
- **Core** (essential subjects building historical and conceptual depth, ~8–12 months)
- **Advanced** (specialization tracks for focused exploration, ~4–6 months)
- **Capstone** (integrative project, ~1–2 months).

Subjects are sequenced logically, with prerequisites noted to ensure progression. Each phase includes milestone assessments for self-evaluation.

**Duration**. 1–2 years, assuming **~20 hours/week**. Learners may speed up or slow down.

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.

## Intro

This phase orients learners to philosophical inquiry, key questions, and basic tools. It builds foundational skills in reasoning and exposes core themes like existence, knowledge, and morality.

| Subject | Why study? | Book | Online Course |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Introduction to Philosophy | To grasp the scope of philosophy, its major branches, and enduring questions, fostering curiosity and critical perspective on life, reality, and values. | [*The Problems of Philosophy*](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/5827) | [Introduction to Philosophy: God, Knowledge and Consciousness](https://mitxonline.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITxT+24.00x/) |
| Critical Thinking and Logic | To develop skills in argument analysis, fallacy detection, and deductive/inductive reasoning, essential for all philosophical work. | [*Introduction to Logic*](http://www.uop.edu.pk/ocontents/Book-Introductiontologic.pdf) | [Logic I](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/24-241-logic-i-fall-2009/) |

**Milestone:** After completing this phase, write a 5–10 page reflective essay on a philosophical question (e.g., "What is the good life?"), incorporating basic logical analysis. This confirms readiness for historical and systematic study.

## Core

This phase covers the historical development of philosophy and its primary branches, equivalent to the bulk of an undergraduate curriculum. It emphasizes understanding ideas in context, comparing thinkers, and applying concepts theoretically and practically (e.g., ethical dilemmas or epistemological puzzles).

Subjects build sequentially: Start with historical surveys before branching into systematic areas.
