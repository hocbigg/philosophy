Path to a free self-taught education in Philosophy!


# Introduction

## Purpose

This curriculum try to give a **well-rounded foundation equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate major** (excluding general-ed), organized for **1–2 years at ~20 hours/week**.

## **Philosophy of the program.**

Philosophy trains careful thinking: conceptual clarity, argument construction, textual interpretation, and the ability to apply abstract ideas to practical and scientific problems. The curriculum balances **historical breadth (Plato → Kant → analytic/post-analytic)** with **tool-building (logic, formal methods)** and **applied areas (ethics, philosophy of mind, science, tech ethics)**. MIT OCW supplies stable, open course material; MOOCs supply structured peer interaction and capstone options.

## Organization

- **Intro (Orientation & fundamentals)** — test fit, build study habits, learn close reading & basic argumentation.
- **Core (roughly first 3 years of a major)** — logic, epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, political philosophy, history of philosophy, philosophy of mind, philosophy of science, and methods.
- **Advanced (final-year electives)** — choose **one specialization** (e.g., Ethics & Moral Psychology; Epistemology & Philosophy of Science; History of Philosophy; Logic & Computation). Complete all advanced courses in one track to develop depth.
- **Final Project (Capstone)** — sustained research/argument project (essay thesis, literature survey + original argument, or applied ethics case study) with peer review and public sharing.

## Duration

**1–2 years** recommended. Pace set to **~20 hours/week** so the learner can finish in 1 year (intensive) or 2 years (sustainable). The program is organized into _Orientation (6–8 wks)_ → _Core (12–14 months)_ → _Advanced (3–4 months)_ → _Capstone (8–12 wks)_.

# TL;DR:

*Study all subjects below, in roughly the presented order*.

| [Problems of Philosophy (24.00)](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/24-00-problems-of-philosophy-fall-2019/) (MIT OCW). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][2]) | 6 wks | 8–10 hrs/wk | None | Short selection approach to core problems (knowledge, mind, ethics). Good first course to test fit. |
| [Logic I (24.241) — Intro to Formal Logic](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/24-241-logic-i-fall-2009/) (MIT OCW). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][3]) | 6 wks | 6–8 hrs/wk | None | Fundamental tools: validity, truth-tables, translations, basic predicate logic. Essential early. |
| Coursera: [Introduction to Philosophy — University of Edinburgh](https://www.coursera.org/learn/philosophy) (MOOC). ([Coursera][4]) | Self-paced | 4–6 hrs/wk | None | Friendly broad intro covering epistemology, ethics, mind, metaphysics — useful as companion to MIT OCW material. |

**Why these first?** Problems of Philosophy (MIT OCW) and an introductory logic course give immediate practice in reading arguments and building them. The Coursera intro provides structured modules and forums for peer discussion.

## Core (Foundational modules — 12–14 months)

Take these modules across ~12 months (concurrent in pairs/triples). OCW provides most materials; MOOCs are recommended for structure/certificates.

### Track 2 — **Epistemology & Philosophy of Science**

- Problems of Philosophy (epistemology modules). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][2])
- Philosophy of Science modules (use OCW readings + Coursera backups on philosophy/science).
- Capstone: literature review + original argument on a contemporary epistemic issue (e.g., testimony, social epistemology, epistemic injustice).

### Track 3 — **Philosophy of Mind & Cognitive Science**

- Minds and Machines; Philosophical Issues in Brain Science. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][9])
- Suggested MOOC backup: cognitive science or neuroscience fundamentals on Coursera/edX.

- Logic I & II (including Gödel, computability). ([MIT OpenCourseWare][3])
- Optional: courses on formal semantics or related CS logic (MIT OCW / Stanford Online).
- Capstone: formal proof project or philosophical paper on logic/semantics.

## Final Project (Capstone) — 8–12 weeks

**Options:**

- A 8,000–12,000 word research thesis (philosophical paper) defending an original argument; **or**
- A sustained literature review + critical synthesis (12–15k words) with a clear original contribution; **or**
- An applied ethics dossier (case analysis, policy recommendations, argumentative defense).

**Milestones**

- **Proposal (week 0–1):** 500–800 word proposal with research questions, key literature, method, and timeline.
- **Annotated Bibliography (wk 2–3):** 15–25 sources with 150–250 word annotations.
- **First Draft (wk 5–6):** 50% complete submission for peer review.
- **Revised Draft (wk 9):** near-final submission with revision log.
- **Final Deliverable (wk 12):** final paper + 1,000-1,500 word reflective artist’s statement and a 10-minute recorded defense.

**Capstone Rubric (100 points)**

- **Argumentative Quality (30):** clarity, structure, logical coherence.
- **Philosophical Depth (25):** engagement with literature, conceptual subtlety.
- **Originality (15):** novelty of position or approach.
- **Method & Evidence (15):** correct use of empirical or textual evidence if applicable.
- **Presentation & Scholarship (10):** citations, formatting, readability, and revision log.

**Peer Review Process**

- Form groups of 3–5; each member reads two drafts and provides structured feedback (3 strengths + 3 suggestions). Use Coursera/edX forums or Discord/Slack groups for exchanges.

# 2) Plan & sequencing — semester roadmap & prerequisite graph

## Roadmap (1-year intensive / 2-year sustainable)

**Fast (1 year)** — 4 terms (~13 weeks each) at ~20 hrs/wk:

- **Term 1 (Orientation + Foundations)**: Problems of Philosophy (OCW) + Logic I (OCW) + Coursera Intro to Philosophy.
- **Term 2 (Core breadth)**: Classics of Western Philosophy (OCW) + Ethics (OCW) + Philosophy of Mind (Minds & Machines OCW).
- **Term 3 (Methods & Applied)**: Logic II (if chosen) or Philosophy of Science modules + Ethics of Technology (OCW) + Moral Psychology (OCW).
- **Term 4 (Advanced + Capstone)**: Choose specialization courses (advanced track) + Capstone research & defense.

**Sustainable (2 years)** — same sequence but spread with extra time for deeper reading, more peer review, optional MOOCs for certificates.

## Prerequisite graph (plain text)

- **Intro (no prereq)** → _Logic I_ recommended early.
- **Logic I** → enables _Logic II_ and improves performance in epistemology/metaphysics.
- **Problems of Philosophy / Classics** → foundation for Ethics, Epistemology, Metaphysics, Philosophy of Mind.
- **Ethics** → metaethics & applied ethics modules.
- **Minds and Machines** → better if you’ve done _Problems of Philosophy_ and some logic, but not strictly required.

(Visual graph you can sketch: Intro courses at top, arrows to Logic I and Classics, feeding into specialized courses.)

# 3) Alternatives & resilience

**Backup options (1–2 per key course):**

- **Problems of Philosophy** (backup): Coursera _Introduction to Philosophy_ (University of Edinburgh). ([Coursera][4])
- **Logic I** (backup): _Introduction to Logic_ MOOC on Coursera (often from Stanford/UCLA), or MIT OCW companion materials from other semesters. (Search Coursera logic). ([Coursera][13])
- **Classics** (backup): Great Books or HarvardX modules on classical texts (edX/Harvard).
- **Philosophy of Mind** (backup): Coursera offerings in cognitive science; edX _Philosophy of Mind_ courses from other universities.
- **Ethics of Technology** (backup): Coursera/edX courses in tech ethics (e.g., "AI Ethics" courses).

**Catch-up modules for gaps**

- **Writing & research methods:** edX / Coursera academic writing courses (e.g., _English for Research_ or _Academic Writing_). These help with essay structure and citation.
- **Math / formal methods (if needed):** Short logic and discrete math refresher modules (Coursera). Logic II covers necessary formal foundations.
- **Philosophical vocabulary & secondary literature:** Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (free) — invaluable for background. (SEP not linked here but widely available.)

**Notes on auditing & free access**

- **MIT OCW**: always free; download lecture notes, readings, assignments. ([MIT OpenCourseWare][1])
- **Coursera/edX**: most content can be **audited** free (videos & readings). Peer-graded assignments and certificates often require payment; you can simulate peer review with a study group. ([Coursera][4])
