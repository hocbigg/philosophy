# Summary

The Philosophy curriculum is a **complete education in Philosophy** using online materials.

This curriculum provides a complete, self-paced education in **Philosophy**, equivalent in coverage and rigor to a 4-year undergraduate major (minus general-education requirements). You’ll develop competence across the major philosophical subfields—logic, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, political philosophy, and the history of philosophy—while also training core skills: close reading, analytical writing, argument reconstruction, conceptual analysis, and research methods.

When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md) or [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

## Organization

* **Intro to Philosophy**: Orientation, study habits, and broad exposure.
* **Core Philosophy**: Foundational courses covering the history of philosophy, formal logic, ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy.
* **Advanced Philosophy**: Final-year style electives organized into specialization tracks.
* **Capstone Project**: A substantial research paper or philosophical project demonstrating mastery.

**Duration**. **1–2 years**, assuming **~20 hours/week**. Learners may speed up or slow down.


**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week. A popular option is to take the math courses in parallel with the introductory courses. Course prerequisites are listed to help you determine if you are prepared for a given course.
- Courses in Advanced are electives. Choose one subject (e.g. ) you want to become an expert in and take all the courses under that heading.
