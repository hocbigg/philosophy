# Summary

This roadmap provides a structured, self-paced program equivalent to a 4-year undergraduate foundation in philosophy, condensed into approximately 1–2 years at 20 hours per week. 

It assumes a commitment to rigorous reading, critical analysis, and written reflection to build analytical skills, ethical reasoning, and philosophical argumentation.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).
