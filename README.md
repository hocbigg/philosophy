# Summary

The Philosophy curriculum is a **complete education in Philosophy** using online materials.

This curriculum provides a complete, self-paced education in **Philosophy**, equivalent in coverage and rigor to a 4-year undergraduate major (minus general-education requirements). You’ll develop competence across the major philosophical subfields—logic, ethics, epistemology, metaphysics, political philosophy, and the history of philosophy—while also training core skills: close reading, analytical writing, argument reconstruction, conceptual analysis, and research methods.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## Organization

* **Intro to Philosophy**: Orientation, study habits, and broad exposure.
* **Core Philosophy**: Foundational courses covering the history of philosophy, formal logic, ethics, metaphysics, epistemology, and political philosophy.
* **Advanced Philosophy**: Final-year style electives organized into specialization tracks.
* **Capstone Project**: A substantial research paper or philosophical project demonstrating mastery.

**Duration**. 1–2 years, assuming **~20 hours/week**. Learners may speed up or slow down.

**Process**. Students can work through the curriculum alone or in groups, in order or out of order.

- We recommend doing all courses in **Core**, only skipping a course when you are certain that you've already learned the material previously.
- For simplicity, we recommend working through courses (especially Core) in order from top to bottom. Some students choose to study multiple courses at a time in order to vary the material they are working on in a day/week.
- The courses in the Advanced section are electives. Choose one track to specialize in and complete all the courses listed under it.
